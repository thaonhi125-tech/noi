# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a React application built with Vite. It has been reset to a clean, secure starting point. All potentially sensitive information has been removed.

## Plan

- The project has been successfully reset.
- All files that may have contained sensitive information have been removed.
- A secure method for handling API keys and other secrets has been established by creating a `.gitignore` file.
- A basic "Hello, World!" application has been implemented to ensure the setup is working correctly.

## Next Steps

- The project is now ready for further development. Please provide your instructions for the next steps.
